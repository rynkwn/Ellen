# Ellen: It doesn't stand for anything

Goal: A simple symbolic knowledge thing for me to sink relaxed hours into.

## Three steps:

1) Specify commands:
- learn(key, textblob) -> TF
- do(key, args, argv) -> acts textblob
- find(thing) -> displays information about a thing.
- behaviormap(?) -> 

2) Create infrastructure
- Store key -> texblob mappings
- Handle duplicate keys.
- Set up some basic actions so that do(key) can run a given program.

3) Create subgoals.
